# Installation

## From Source

Currently, the only available installation method is by compiling from source
locally or within a Docker container environment. Other methods such as binary
packages and
[PyBOMBS](https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/2016-06-19-pybombs-the-what-the-how-and-the-why/)
will be provided in the future.

To build from source, run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/igorauad/gr-dvbs2rx.git
cd gr-dvbs2rx/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Next, test the built binaries by running:
```
ctest
```

Finally, install by executing:
```
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
## Docker Image

A Dockerfile is available with a recipe for a Ubuntu-based Docker image
featuring GNU Radio and gr-dvbs2rx. To build it, run:

```
docker build -t gr-dvbs2rx .
```

## Further Information

### Build Options

When compiling from source, the CMake build can be customized by the following
options:

- `BENCHMARK_CPU`: when set to ON, builds an application for CPU benchmarking of
  selected functions. The application becomes available at `bench/cpu/bench_cpu`
  relative to the build directory. This feature requires the [libbenchmark
  library](https://github.com/google/benchmark).

- `BENCHMARK_FEC`: when set to `ON`, builds an application to assess the
  performance of various forward error correction (FEC) configurations. The
  current implementation focuses on the PLSC decoder and yields the `bench_plsc`
  application at the `bench/fec/` subdirectory of the build directory. This
  option requires the [aff3ct library](http://aff3ct.github.io) (version 3.0.0
  or later).

- `DEBUG_LOGS`: when set to OFF, disables the low-level logs available by
  default to debug the physical layer operation.

- `NATIVE_OPTIMIZATIONS`: when set to ON, compiles the dvbs2rx library using the
  `-march=native` flag to enable optimizations for the local CPU. Use this
  option to obtain improved CPU performance, as long as your goal is to run the
  project on the same machine used for compilation. Do not use this option if
  compiling binaries to run on other CPUs.

> Note the build options must be specified on the `cmake` step. For example, for
> an option named `MYOPTION`, append either `-DMYOPTION=ON` or `-DMYOPTION=OFF`
> to the `cmake ..` step.
